# Participants

 The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

## [Adapter   (ChemicalCompound)](https://github.com/arminatwork/DesignPatterns/Structural/Adapter_Example/Adapter)

 adapts the interface Adaptee to the Target interface.

## [Target   (Compound)](https://github.com/arminatwork/DesignPatterns/Structural/Adapter_Example/Target)

 defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses.

## [Adaptee   (ChemicalDatabank)](https://github.com/arminatwork/DesignPatterns/Structural/Adapter_Example/Adaptee)

 defines an existing interface that needs adapting.

## [Client   (AdapterApp)](https://github.com/arminatwork/DesignPatterns/Structural/Adapter_Example/Program.cs)

 collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.
